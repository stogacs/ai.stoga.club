        <h1>About</h1>
        <p class="code">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is everywhere and you may not even know it. It is even applied in
            the most obvious to the most bizarre of fields: from natural language processing in Alexa to electronic
            dream generation in Dreamscape. With AI improving and gaining prominence at an exponential rate, students
            should gain early access to explore this technology. Our mission is to empower students to explore AI and
            its intersection with a diverse range of applications. We provide experiential learning opportunities
            through interactive lectures, monthly guest presenters, and workshops to students beyond our school.</p>

        <h1>Teaching Digital Literacy (TDL)</h1>
        <p class="code">
            Data shows 40% of the USA is digitally literate. Even in the Philadelphia area, 80% of schools lack classes
            on basic computational skills, let alone coding. This invaluable skill is vital for students to develop at
            an early age as it is critical for our near digital future. Further, without diverse involvement of
            low-income and underrepresented communities, technology (like AI) will not become inclusive.
            This youth-led project aims to increase digital literacy and combat learning loss in the Philadelphia region
            through workshops, peer tutoring, and guest lectures. Our mission is to help underserved youth gain a
            standing within the growing digital world.
